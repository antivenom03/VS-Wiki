Characters are exactly what they sound like, they're the players' way of playing the game

Every character controls the same, moving up, down, left, right, etc. and attacking automatically

Each character comes with unique starting stats, a starting weapon, and a unique passive ability, which is usually affects that character's stats overtime.
